# addingTwoNumbers
Audition by adding two numbers together, providing a JUnit and a README File


USER INSTRUCTIONS
if you are a user the process is simple. just run the application. When prompted to enter numbers just enter them using your keyboard and press the enter key.

DEVELOPER INSTRUCTIONS
If you wish to develop this program further you will need an IDE capable of running the code (i.e Eclipse, Netbeans, InteliJ, etc.), you will need the latest version of Java, and you will need this project. Comments have been provided within the program to help you understand things easier. Once you have all these things just open this project in your chosen IDE and alter it as you see fit. I have stored each number as an individual variable allowing full control over all three numbers. I have also separated each method all in the hope of making it easier for you to understand.

Happy Coding!
