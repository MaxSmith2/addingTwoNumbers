# addingTwoNumbers
Audition by adding two numbers together, providing a JUnit and a README File


USER INSTRUCTIONS
if you are a user the process is a little tedious but well worth it. First thing we need to do is install Java (You can find that at the following link: https://java.com/en/download/help/index_installing.xml). Now we have the setup, let's get into how to run the file.

To run the application open the Add folder and locate the runme.jar file. right click on this and select "properties". take a look at the location it is stored as you are now going to go into the Command Prompt and run it.

1) open your command prompt by searching "cmd" into your start bar.
2) use the expression "cd" to locate the folder the runme.jar is in. for more information on cd look here http://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands
3) once you are in the same folder as your runme.jar use the following expression "java -jar runme.jar"
4) your java file should be up and ready to use.

When prompted to enter numbers just enter them using your keyboard and press the enter key.

DEVELOPER INSTRUCTIONS
If you wish to develop this program further you will need an IDE capable of running the code (i.e Eclipse, Netbeans, InteliJ, etc.), you will need the latest version of Java, and you will need this project. Comments have been provided within the program to help you understand things easier. Once you have all these things just open this project in your chosen IDE (this can be done by going into your IDE, right clicking on your workspace, selecting Import and following the on-screen prompts) and alter it as you see fit. I have stored each number as an individual variable allowing full control over all three numbers. I have also separated each method all in the hope of making it easier for you to understand.

Happy Coding!
